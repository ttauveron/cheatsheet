### Alternate Data Streams (ADS)

Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a file attribute specific to Windows NTFS (New Technology File System).

Every file has at least one data stream (`$DATA`), and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. Natively [Window Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-s-changed-in-file-explorer-ef370130-1cca-9dc5-e0df-2f7416fe1cb1) doesn't display ADS to the user. There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1) gives you the ability to view ADS for files.

From a security perspective, malware writers have used ADS to hide data.

Not all its uses are malicious. For example, when you download a file from the Internet, there are identifiers written to ADS to identify that the file was downloaded from the Internet.

To learn more about ADS, refer to the following link from MalwareBytes [here](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2015/07/introduction-to-alternate-data-streams/).&#x20;

**Bonus**: If you wish to interact hands-on with ADS, I suggest exploring Day 21 of [Advent of Cyber 2](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2).

_BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers_

_BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later. The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. It works with BitLocker to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline_

Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) coordinates the required actions to create a consistent shadow copy (also known as a snapshot or a point-in-time copy) of the data that is to be backed up.

_A_ttackers use built-in Windows tools and utilities in an attempt to go undetected within the victim environment.  This tactic is known as Living Off The Land. Refer to the following resource [here](https://lolbas-project.github.io/) to learn more about this. \
