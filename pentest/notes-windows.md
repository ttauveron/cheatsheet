### Alternate Data Streams (ADS)

Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a file attribute specific to Windows NTFS (New Technology File System).

Every file has at least one data stream (`$DATA`), and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. Natively [Window Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-s-changed-in-file-explorer-ef370130-1cca-9dc5-e0df-2f7416fe1cb1) doesn't display ADS to the user. There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1) gives you the ability to view ADS for files.

From a security perspective, malware writers have used ADS to hide data.

Not all its uses are malicious. For example, when you download a file from the Internet, there are identifiers written to ADS to identify that the file was downloaded from the Internet.

To learn more about ADS, refer to the following link from MalwareBytes [here](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2015/07/introduction-to-alternate-data-streams/).&#x20;

**Bonus**: If you wish to interact hands-on with ADS, I suggest exploring Day 21 of [Advent of Cyber 2](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2).
